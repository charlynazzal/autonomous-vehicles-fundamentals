# Vehicle Mass (kg): Total weight of the vehicle, important for calculating forces and acceleration

# Engine Power (kW): The power output of the engine (1 kW â‰ˆ 1.34 horsepower)

# Power-to-Weight Ratio: Engine power divided by vehicle mass - key for performance

# Fuel Capacity/Current Fuel: Fuel system parameters (in liters)

# Estimated Range: How far the vehicle can travel with current fuel (km)

# The vehicle's mass affects braking distance and acceleration

# Power-to-weight ratio impacts merging and passing capabilities

# Fuel/energy status determines operational range

# Range estimation is crucial for route planning
